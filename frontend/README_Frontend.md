# Habit Tracker App with Virtual Mentor
## Project Overview
This project is a habit-tracking mobile application designed to help users develop mindfulness, productivity, and healthy habits through persistent reminders and interaction with a virtual mentor. The app will provide motivational nudges, reminders for breaks, work sessions, and daily activities such as drinking water or going to bed. It will also offer gamification features to reward users for their productivity and encourage self-support through positive reinforcement.
The key feature of the app is the virtual mentor, powered by a language model (LLM), which interacts with users through a chat interface. The mentor analyzes user behavior patterns and provides personalized recommendations based on the user’s progress and activity data. The app is designed to be more persistent than a typical alarm clock, ensuring that users stay engaged and mindful of their actions throughout the day.
## Core Features
### 1. User Profile
Users can create and manage their profiles.
Track personal data such as habits, goals, and progress.
### 2. Habit Tracker
Users can add conscious habits (manually added by the user) and unconscious habits (suggested based on chat analysis).
Track both positive and negative habits that need improvement.
Visualize progress through reports and statistics.
### 3. Adaptive Reminder System
Automatically adjusts reminders based on user activity.
Persistent reminders that cannot be easily dismissed or ignored:
"What are you doing right now?"
"How's your mood?"
"Are you tired? Time for a break."
"Time to get back to work."
"Shut down devices and go to sleep."
"It's time to work on your habit."
Reminders are designed to ensure users take action and cannot simply swipe them away.
### 4. Virtual Mentor (LLM-based)
Chat with the virtual mentor: The mentor reads user reports, extracts tokens representing the user’s current state or success, and fills out reports.
Provides motivation when users are tired or lose focus.
Offers recommendations on how to achieve goals based on user data and statistics.
Detects behavior patterns through time-series analysis or machine learning algorithms.
Offers immediate value from the first day of use by providing actionable feedback.
### 5. Gamification & Rewards
Users receive rewards at the end of productive intervals.
Encourages users to support themselves with positive reinforcement after completing tasks.
Competitive elements allow users to leverage social pressure for achieving goals.
### 6. App Usage Tracking
Tracks usage of other apps to compare user behavior and provide insights into how time is spent.
### 7. Calendar Integration
Integrates with Google Calendar or other calendar apps for convenient scheduling of reminders in a familiar format.
## Architecture Overview
The application consists of several layers:
### 1. Frontend (Flutter)
The frontend is a cross-platform mobile application built using Flutter, which supports both iOS and Android devices. It provides users with:
A chat interface for interacting with the virtual mentor.
A habit tracker for adding, viewing, and managing habits.
Notifications for reminders and recommendations from the virtual mentor.
### 2. Backend (Node.js + MongoDB)
The backend is built using Node.js with a MongoDB database for storing user data, habits, reminders, and progress:
Express.js is used for creating RESTful APIs that handle requests from the mobile app.
Socket.IO is used for real-time persistent notifications.
### 3. AI Components (LLM Integration)
The virtual mentor is powered by an LLM (Language Learning Model) API such as OpenAI’s GPT:
The LLM agent interacts with users via chat, providing motivation, recommendations, and feedback based on behavioral data.
The agent analyzes user behavior patterns using machine learning algorithms to provide personalized advice.
